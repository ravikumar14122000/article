	  <p>President<strong> Vladimir Putin</strong> told Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan he was open to dialogue with Ukraine if Kyiv accepts territories occupied by Moscow as Russian, the Kremlin said Thursday.
"Putin again confirmed Russia's openness to serious dialogue on the condition of Kyiv authorities<b> fulfilling the well-known and repeatedly</b> voiced requirements of taking into account the new territorial realities," the Kremlin said in a statement.
Erdogan had called<b> for peace talks in the phone call with Putin, his office said earlier.</b>
  <ol>Russian troops occupy large <li>swathes of eastern and southern Ukraine.</li><b>
   The Kremlin claims it has annexed the Donetsk, Lugansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions despite not controlling them in their entirety.
"The Russian side emphasised the destructive role of Western states, pumping the Kyiv regime with weapons and military equipment, providing it with operational information and targets," the statement added.
 <ol>The leaders also discussed the <strong>implementation of a landmark grain deal,</strong> brokered by the UN with the help of Turkey, to unblock Ukrainian grain.
The Kremlin said the pair discussed "the unblocking of food<li> and fertiliser supplies from Russia" and the need for "the removal of all barriers to Russian exports."
Russia briefly exited the deal in October after a drone attack on its Black Sea Fleet</li>. It re-entered the deal within days but officials have complained of restrictions on Russian products.t global conflicts in history. The  belligerents included much of Europe and their colonial empires, the Russian Empire, the United States, the Ottoman Empire and the Japanese Empire, with fighting occurring throughout Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Pacific, and parts of Asia. An estimated 9 million soldiers were killed in combat, plus another 23 million wounded, while 5 million civilians died as a result of military action, hunger, and disease.[2] Millions more died in genocides within the Ottoman Empire and in the influenza pandemic, which was exacerbated by the movement of combatants during the war.[3][4]
Prior to  the European great powers were divided between the Triple Entente (comprising France, Russia, and Britain) and the Triple Alliance (containing Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy). Tensions in the Balkans came to a head on 28 June 1914, following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary by Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian Serb. Austria-Hungary blamed Serbia, which led to the July Crisis, an unsuccessful attempt to avoid conflict through diplomacy. On 28 July 1914, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, while Russia came to the latter's defence. By  Germany, France, and Britain (along with their respective colonies) were also drawn into the war. In November 1914, the Ottoman Empire, Germany, and Austria-Hungary formed the Central Powers, and on 26 April 1915, Italy joined Britain, France, Russia, and Serbia as the Allies of World War I.

<h2><center>Russian military bases in Crimea</h2></b></center> 
At the onset of the<mark> conflict, Russia had roughly 12,000 military personnel in the Black Sea Fleet,[36] in several locations in the Crimean peninsula like Sevastopol, Kacha, Hvardiiske, Simferopol Raion, Sarych, and others.</mark> In 2005 a dispute broke out over control of the Sarych cape lighthouse near Yalta, and a number of other beacons.[38][39] Russian presence was allowed by the basing and transit agreement with Ukraine. Under the agreements the Russian military in Crimea was constrained to a maximum of 25,000 troops;<strong> they were required to: respect the sovereignty of Ukraine,</strong> honor its <ul>legislation, not interfere in the internal affairs of the country, and show their "military identification cards" </ul>when crossing the international border.[40] Early in the conflict, the agreement's sizeable troop limit allowed Russia to significantly reinforce its military presence under the plausible guise of security concerns, deploy special forces and other required capabilities to conduct the operation in Crimea.[36]

<ol> According to the original treaty on the division of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet signed in 1997,</ol> Russia was allowed to have its military bases in Crimea until 2017, after which it would evacuate all military units including its portion of the Black Sea Fleet out of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.<mark> On 21 April 2010, former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych</mark> signed a new deal known as the Kharkiv Pact,<b> to resolve the 2009 Russia–Ukraine gas dispute; it extended the stay to 2042 with an option </b>
